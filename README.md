# Newton-Raphson

note to users:\
if you want to enter your own roots\
you need to edit the variable 'roots'\
in the file 'roots.py'\
'roots' must be an array\
of all roots to be used\
example: roots = [1,-1,quat(0,1,0,0)]\
is a polynomial\
with roots at 1, -1, and i\
 \
I recommend you keep the images small\
around 200x200\
to avoid taking forever\
 \
but for larger images\
lower the number of iterations\
in the 'newtons' function\
